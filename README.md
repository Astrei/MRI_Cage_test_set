# MRI_Cage_test_set
This is an open-source 3d printed antenna set for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) RF-cages attenuation measurements. It is also suitable for localizing breaches in cages walls and sources of external RF interference. The set consists of two symmetrical loop magnetic antennas, each of which is equipped with six matching boxes for different MRI operating frequencies.

An example of using a set of antennas to find a wall problem. Antennas could be connected to any type of RF measuring equipment or signal generators to perform measurements. In general, antenna #1 is connected to the signal generator and antenna #2 is connected to the receiver (spectrum analyzer, SDR, etc.).
