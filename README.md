# MRI_Cage_test_set
This is an open-source 3d printed antenna set for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) RF-cages attenuation measurements. It is also suitable for localizing breaches in cages walls and sources of external RF interference. The set consists of two symmetrical loop magnetic antennas, each of which is equipped with six matching boxes for different MRI operating frequencies. Please note that you will need a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) to build this project!

An example of using a set of antennas to find a wall problem. 

Antennas could be used with any type of 50 Ohm RF equipment to perform measurements. In general, antenna #1 is connected to the signal generator and antenna #2 is connected to the receiver (spectrum analyzer, SDR, etc.). Of course, one antenna should be placed inside the cage and the other outside. 

The MRI scanner itself can also be used as a signal source. In this case, one antenna is sufficient.
